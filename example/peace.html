                <h3>Harmony in communities</h3>
				<br>
				<p>The willingness to foster harmony within communities is important. It allows for opportunities for people to bond, support each other in times of need and creates an overall positive environment where everyone feels welcome. When there is harmony within a community there is less antisocial behaviour and crime . Harmony within a community makes people feel safer in their daily lives as there is less tension amongst different cultures and less crime rates as previously mentioned. A harmonious community makes others feel welcome to enter such communities as they can see that everyone already present in those communities is satisfied with the dynamics of how everyone lives in unison with eachother and is willing to support one another when someone requires it. Harmony can be instilled in communities in many ways through educating children in school to be open and welcoming to other cultures and organising community events for people to come together and share their ways of life with one another.

                <h3>Improved quality of life</h3>
				<br>
			<p> Harmonious communities have better mental health as they are more willing to organise and participate in social events with one another.People living in harmonious areas have a better quality of life as they feel supported and are not isolated.Harmonious communities are more likely to make an effort to colloborate with each other to make improvements to their community with things such as infrastructure and services. As they support each other it also builds trust within the community as people realise through colloboration that they can depend on one another. A happy, peaceful community also attracts new trade and job opportunities which overall provides an enjoyable lifestyle for those who live there as they have all the amenities they require.Overall fostering harmony within a community leads to a better quality of life as everything runs more smoothly within the community and there is a positive atmoshphere which makes people feel safe and welcomed.  </p>

                <h3>Opportunities for education</h3>
				<br>
				<p>Harmony within a community ensures there are opportunities for quality education. Harmony in a community ensures that the learning environment is supportive and safe as there is no conflict. It also promotes opportunities for families to collaborate with schools to improve education for those in the community. Harmony is also linked with inclusivity were all learners from different backgrounds and cultures are welcomed.If there is harmony within a community children can access education safely and are more relaxed which overall enhances their learning. When parents feel that the community they live in cares about harmony and is willing to be inclusive it makes them more willing to contribute and support the works of schools. This can assist in progressing educational opportunities within a community as parents can assist in sharing opinions on what could be improved and contributing time to assist in fundraising that can be used to improve educational facilities and opportunities for present and future generations in the community.

                <h3>Stability for future generations</h3>
				<br>
				<p>How can we as a society contribute to stability for the future? 
				   What is considered as stability in life? 
				    These are some of the wonders that everyone must have when they think about the future. Why is that so important?
					The future is very important for those who care about their family and the society. All future generations will depend on what efforts are made  nowadays. This includes things such as enhanced security,caring for the environment,having a financially stable economy and developing infrastructure to be suitable for the needs of the growing population. There are many others things that society is yet to identify that will also be important to consider to ensure there is stability in the world for future generations. By making the efforts now to build stability within society this will assist in people living happier, less stressful lives. When there is less stress it in turn helps to foster peace and allow it to grow within communities.
