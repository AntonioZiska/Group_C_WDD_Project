                        <p> War is a beast that leaves its mark on everyone, whether you're a soldier or a civilian. Yeah, soldiers and civilians both get caught up in the chaos, but it's the women and kids who often face the worst of it. Can you believe that in the last ten years, around two million kids have been killed in armed conflicts? That's just heartbreaking. All this violence leaves behind scars, not just on the body but on the mind too. The emotional and psychological stress is a heavy burden to bear.

                        These days, internal wars seem to hit civilians harder than wars between countries. Why? Because it's like targeting civilians has become part of the game plan for fighters. It's messed up. A state conflict, by the way, is when there's a fight involving a government and some other group. The big question is: what can be done about it? The UN faces three big challenges here. First, will its members, especially the powerful ones, step in to help? Second, does the UN have the capability to act? And lastly, should the old peacekeeping methods be used for these internal conflicts? It's a lot to think about..</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>War can really mess up the environment, you know? It’s not just about the fighting; it’s the aftermath too. You’ve got deforestation, land that’s just trashed, and pollution everywhere—from bombs, chemicals, and all that waste. And think about it: ecosystems get wrecked, which means the animals and even us humans are in trouble. Contaminated water and soil stick around for ages, causing all sorts of health issues. It’s a real bummer, isn’t it? I mean, who wants to live in a place where the air and water can't be trusted? Not me, that's for sure.</p>

                    <h3>Economic Devastation</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>War is like a wrecking ball for the economy. It pulls money away from things people need, like schools and hospitals, and throws it at military stuff. Businesses end up in ruins, factories close their doors, and trade just can't catch a break. This mess can drag on for ages, leading to a recession that feels never-ending. And let's not forget about the job losses and prices going up, which hit folks where it hurts the most—in their wallets. Ever thought about how this affects daily life? It's huge. People can't find jobs, and everything costs more. It's like trying to climb a mountain with a backpack full of rocks.</p>

              <h3>Destruction of Infrastructure:</h3>
                  <br>
                    <p>War really messes things up, doesn't it? I mean, it tears apart infrastructure like homes, schools, hospitals, and roads. It's like a tornado hit everything all at once. And when that happens, essential services are totally thrown off track. Fixing all this? Well, that can take decades, and that's no exaggeration. The cost of putting everything back together again is huge, not to mention the people who have to leave their homes because of it. It's like trying to put together a puzzle with missing pieces. And let's be honest, that makes bouncing back as a country pretty darn tough.</p>

			   <h3>Loss of Lives and Suffering</h3>
		   <br>
		<p>War's a real nightmare, isn't it? It claims countless lives, from soldiers on the frontlines to innocent civilians caught in the crossfire. And it's not just about those who die. The folks who make it through are often left dealing with some heavy stuff—like PTSD and other emotional scars that might never fully heal. Families and communities? They feel the impact for generations. It's like a ripple effect that just keeps going. And honestly, who can blame them? It's tough to move on when the past keeps haunting you.
